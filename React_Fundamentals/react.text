--React is Library

--Google it 
-babel , fiber, Virtual DOM
-Diff algo and Hydrenation 


// Roadmap
--Topic to learn in React JS
- Core of rect JS (State , DOM Manipulation , JSX)
- Compoment Reuse
- Resuing of Compoment (Props)
- How to propogate Change (Hooks)


-- Additional  addon  to React
- Router (React dont have Router)
- State Management (React dont have State Management ,, Redux, Toolkit, contextAPI)
- class Based Compoment
- Best Backend as a Service  (BAAS)



// React Behind the scence
- React Fiber is core react algorithm (hard to Understand )
- Fiber Algo is complext algo , used to Manipulation of Dom
- it help to quick response like amination, layout etc

//headline feature is incremental rendering 
-- its ability to control the tree 
-- it contorl the only perticuler part of tree that which part need to be updated , not all tree

// Other key feature called as hydration
- ability to pause, abort and new update (priority to diff  type of update)

// Reconciliation
--The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
-- A change in the data used to render a React app using id= root . 
-- Usually the result of `setState`. 
-- Eventually results in a re-render.

-----Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."
 A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, 
 a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. 
 This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment â€” for example, 
 in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. 
 When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. 
 The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

 check the Diff betweenn, one tree (react tree) and second is window DOM tree
